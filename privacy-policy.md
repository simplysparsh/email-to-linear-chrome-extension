## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the Email to Linear Chrome Extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our service. We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of your data.

## 2. Information We Collect

The Extension collects the following information **only when you explicitly initiate an action**:

## 3. How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used solely for the purpose of:

* Converting email content into Linear issues at your request
* Preserving your preferences for future use of the Extension
* Improving the functionality of the Extension

## 4. Data Storage

* **Local Storage**: All user preferences (teams, assignees, priorities) are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API
* **Temporary Storage**: Selected text and extracted content is temporarily stored in memory only while the Extension is in use
* **No External Databases**: We do not maintain any external databases of your information

## 5. Data Sharing

* **Linear**: Email content and metadata is only shared with Linear when you explicitly choose to create an issue
* **No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties

## 7. Security Measures

* **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs locally within your browser
* **Limited Access**: The Extension only accesses Gmail data when you are actively using it

## 8. Limited Scope

The Extension:
