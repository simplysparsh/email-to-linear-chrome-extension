## Features

### Content Sources

The extension works with multiple content sources:
- **Fathom Meeting Summaries**: Automatically extracts action items and next steps
- **Selected Text**: Use any text you select in an email
- **Regular Emails**: Extract content from any email, not just Fathom summaries

### Automatic Content Extraction

The extension automatically detects and extracts:
- Action items from Fathom meeting summaries
- Next steps from Fathom meeting summaries
- Email metadata (subject, sender, date)

### Content Editing

You can edit the extracted content before sending it to Linear:
- Use the formatting buttons (Bold, Italic, Underline)
- Edit the text directly in the content area
- Clear the content with the "Clear" button
- Refresh the content with the "Refresh Content" button

### Issue Details

Configure your Linear issue with:
- **Title**: Automatically populated from the email subject or Fathom title
- **Team**: Select from predefined teams or add a custom team
- **Priority**: Choose from Urgent, High, Medium, or Low
- **Assignee**: Enter the name of the person to assign the issue to

### Movable Dialog

For a better workflow, you can:
1. Click "Open as Movable Dialog"
2. This opens a draggable window that stays open while you navigate between emails
3. Drag the dialog by its header to reposition it

The movable dialog is built directly into Gmail's interface (rather than as a separate window) to provide seamless integration and access to email content.

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Works with Any Email**: While the extension has special features for Fathom, you can use it with any email by selecting text or using the context menu

2. **Custom Teams**: Select "Custom Team" from the dropdown to add a team not in the predefined list

3. **Quick Refresh**: If you open a different email, use the "Refresh Content" button to extract content from the new email

4. **Assignee Memory**: The extension remembers your last used assignee to save time

5. **Context Menu**: Right-click anywhere in Gmail to access extension features without clicking the toolbar icon

6. **Content Source**: The extension shows the source of the extracted content below the content area

## Troubleshooting

### Content Not Extracting

If the extension fails to extract content:
1. Make sure you're viewing a complete email (not just the preview)
2. Try refreshing the page and the extension
3. Use the manual selection method as a fallback
